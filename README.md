    The Impact of AI on Humans  There are a lot of people out there
    who believe that artificial intelligence is going to be the end of
    mankind. This belief seems to be supported by a few people who are
    willing to admit that they don’t know everything about AI but have
    some strong opinions about it. In this article, I want to address
    a few questions that will help us to understand the impact of AI
    on humanity.  Before I get into the discussion, I want to clarify
    something: I am not a “humanity optimist.” I believe that humanity
    will always have problems and that we will always face challenges.
    It’s just that many of these problems are not because of
    technological advances. What I am trying to do here is to show
    that there is an exponential growth in the problem space that is
    caused by technological advances. If we look at history, we see
    that once a problem is solved with technology, the same problem
    reappears somewhere else. For example, you can find someone who
    thinks that AI is going to be the end of mankind in every country
    around the world. I would like to challenge this individual to
    find another country where the same problem occurs.  Let’s start
    with the question: How big is the problem space?
